    "## Density Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "Density matrices present an alternate way to describe quantum states. There are two main motivations for this new representation. First, so far we have only been discussing pure states. But there can be instances where some process prepares different states with certain probabilities. For example, if we have a situation where a process prepares state $\\rvert\\psi_1\\rangle$ with probability $p_1$ and state $\\rvert\\psi_1\\rangle$ with probability $p_2$ then we need a way to accurately express this by taking both the state and probabilities into account. This is called a mixed state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second motivation for density matrices comes from desire to represent the state of a qubit that is a part of an entangled set of qubits. We haven't discussed multi-qubit systems yet but we've alluded to the fact that if two quantum states cannot be represented as tensor product of individual states then they are entangled. Therefore it seems that it would be impossible to just write the state of one qubit by itself. Density matrices help us do this. We will discuss multi-qubit systems in more detail in upcoming lessons."
