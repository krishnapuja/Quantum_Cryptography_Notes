    "As one can imagine, to do anything useful on a quantum computer we will have to deal with multiple qubits at any given time. For example a quantum computer may have a register that can hold 8 qubits at any given time. We already know how to represent the state of any single qubit in the register. However, if we can represent the state of the entire system we can do much more than what we've seen so far with the qubits. For example, we can now apply two or even three qubit gates that operate on more than one qubit at a time. We can also represent, what are called entangled qubits or EPR pairs after their discovers Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen. EPR pairs are very powerful tools in quantum cryptography and the famous application of quantum teleportation.\n"

    "Unlike classical systems, the state space of a quantum system grows exponentially with the number of qubits. For example, there are at the most $2^n$ possible states of a system consisting of $n$-classical bits. However, a $n$-qubit quantum system can have many more states than just $2^n$. In fact, it can have infinite possible states!\n",
