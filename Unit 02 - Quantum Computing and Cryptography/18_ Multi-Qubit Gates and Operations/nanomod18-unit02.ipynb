    "There are “true” multi-qubit gates that cannot be decomposed into individual single qubit gates and therefore __must__ act on multiple qubits together. This is very helpful and can be used to do things that single qubit gates cannot.  The most popular gate that will appear all over the place is a CNOT gate, short for controlled-NOT. In general, we can create an arbitrary controlled-U, gate where U is some 2x2 unitary transformation. Some other gates that appear are Toffoli gate (3 qubit gate) and Fredkin gate (3 qubit gate). Let’s discuss the matrix representation and effect of these gates on our qubits\n"
