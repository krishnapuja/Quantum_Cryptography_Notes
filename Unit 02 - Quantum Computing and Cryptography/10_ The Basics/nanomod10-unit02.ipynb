    "\n",
    "Writing out matrices in sentence is quite unseemly. Therefore, we introduce a new notation called the Dirac's notation (Paul Dirac first used this notation in 1958). Bits 0 and 1 will then be written as $\\left|0\\right>$ and $\\left|1\\right>$, where $\\left|0\\right> = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",

    "\n",
    "We will see that ket notation is quite useful in quantum theory and is more general than just writing bits 0 and 1. In fact, what sets quantum theory apart from classical theory is that in classical systems a bit can only be in state $\\left|0\\right>$ or state $\\left|1\\right>$ and never in both simultaneously. Whereas in a quantum system, a <b>quantum bit</b> (<i>qubit</i> for short) can be in both the states $\\left|0\\right>$ and $\\left|1\\right>$ simultaneously. When this happens, we say that the qubit is in superposition of $\\left|0\\right>$ and $\\left|1\\right>$."

    "A central concept and a major departure from classical thinking and modeling of the systems is that the state vector in quantum systems should not be interpreted as our \"lack\" of knowledge of the state of the system. In fact, if we say that a quantum system is in state $\\begin{bmatrix}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\end{bmatrix}$ then the system is simultaneously in both states $\\left|0\\right>$ and $\\left|1\\right>$! Therefore, we say that the system is in superposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is quite different from saying that the system is in state $\\left|0\\right>$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ and in state $\\left|1\\right>$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$. Now when we actually measure a quantum state then it will collapse to one of the two basis states with equal probability, which in this case are $\\left|0\\right>$ and $\\left|1\\right>$. But before the measurement has taken place, it is in both the states simultaneously.\n",

    "In general when we say that a vector $\\rvert\\psi\\rangle$ can be represented as a linear combination of vectors $\\rvert b_1\\rangle$, $\\rvert b_2\\rangle$, $\\ldots$, $\\rvert b_n\\rangle$, we mean that there exists some complex coefficients $c_i$ such that $\\rvert\\psi\\rangle=c_1\\rvert b_1\\rangle+c_2\\rvert b_2\\rangle+\\ldots+c_n\\rvert b_n\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of vectors $B$ is said to be a basis set if every element in the complex vector space defined by $B$ can be represented as a complex linear combination of the vectors in $B$, uniquely. Therefore, in a two-dimensional vector space any two vectors that cannot be written as multiples of each other form a basis. Typically, in quantum mechanics, we will want to use only orthonormal basis. The two vectors $\\{\\rvert0\\rangle, \\rvert1\\rangle\\}$ represent one such basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to determine if two vectors are orthogonal to each other we simply check if their inner product is zero. Recall that the inner product for complex vectors $v_1$ and $v_2$ is defined as the $v_1^\\dagger\\cdot v_2$. In Dirac's notation, we write $\\langle\\psi\\rvert$ to represent a dagger operation on the complex vector. This is called the bra notation and the inner product of two complex vectors representing two qubit state $\\rvert\\psi\\rangle$ and $\\rvert\\phi\\rangle$ can be written as $\\langle\\psi\\rvert\\rvert\\phi\\rangle$. Since we are lazy we drop the double lines in the middle and write $\\left<\\psi\\rvert\\phi\\right>$.\n",

    "Now back to the problem at hand! We say that two states are orthogonal to each other if the inner product of the complex vectors representing these states is zero, i.e. $\\left<\\psi\\rvert\\phi\\right>=0$. Further if in addition the norm of the vectors $\\rvert\\rvert\\psi\\rangle\\rvert=\\sqrt{\\left<\\psi\\rvert\\psi\\right>}=1$ and $\\rvert\\rvert\\phi\\rangle\\rvert=1$ then we say that the two vectors are orthonormal.\n",
