    "## 25.1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Coding theory and cryptography are two most intricately connected subjects. In several cases, cryptosystems are simply error correction codes for which the decoding matrix forms the key. For example, the post-quantum encryption algorithm called McEllice cryptosystem is based on Goppa codes. There are numerous other examples where polynomial arithmetic is used for encryption and key management. Therefore, it is important for anyone learning cryptography (or quantum cryptography) to be familiar with the theory of quantum error correction codes. This lesson will provide a brief introduction to the topic in order to wet the appetite of the reader. For further details, the reader should refer to books mentioned in the preface of this unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Qubits are prone to errors during transit from sender to receiver. In classical communication, we only concern ourselves with bit flip errors where a transmitted 0 changes to 1 and vice versa. With qubits we have to theoretically worry about infinite number of possible errors because a qubit is a continuum state described by $\\alpha|0\\rangle+\\beta|1\\rangle$ with $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ being complex numbers. An error in such a qubit would amount to $\\alpha$ changing to some $\\alpha'$ and $\\beta$ changing to $\\beta'$. For the longest time it was believed that such errors cannot be corrected because every value of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ is possible and, therefore, one cannot distinguish between a valid state and an invalid state. However, in 1995 Peter Shor proved everyone wrong by inventing quantum error correction and providing a 9-qubit coding scheme that can correct any arbitrary single qubit error. Later this code was refined to 7-qubit and 5-qubit schemes where the latter is the most efficient a single qubit error correction scheme can be. \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides errors that can happen during qubits transit, a qubit can also suffer with errors because of imperfect implementation of hardware that creates these error correcting codes. Correcting such errors falls under the field of fault-tolerant quantum computing and will not concern us here.\n",

    "## 25.2 Errors in Qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "The two types of errors that immediately come to mind are bit flip errors and phase flip errors. When a bit flip error occurs a qubit $|\\psi\\rangle=\\alpha|0\\rangle+\\beta|1\\rangle$ becomes $|\\psi\\rangle=\\beta|0\\rangle+\\alpha|1\\rangle$. In a phase flip error, the relative sign between $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ switches, i.e. $|\\psi\\rangle=\\alpha|0\\rangle+\\beta|1\\rangle$ becomes $|\\psi\\rangle=\\alpha|0\\rangle-\\beta|1\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will discuss how to correct these basic errors separately and then together in a combined scheme. Later, we will show that any arbitrary qubit error can be converted into a bit flip or a phase flip error and therefore, correcting these two types of errors suffices for all purposes. This is quite a surprising result because although there are infinite number of errors possible, they can be discretized to just two types of simple errors."

    "\n",
    "While thinking in terms of bit-flip and phase-flip errors in nice, correcting these errors is not as straight forward. Features that we saw help enable quantum cryptography become the main hurdles here. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. No-cloning: The simplest method of implementing error correction with classical bits is repetition codes. Errors can then be corrected using a majority voting mechanism. These work for classical bits because a classical bit can be read and copied as many times as we want. Qubits on the other hand are destroyed (collapse) once they are read (measured). Further, measurement of a single qubit only reveals a bit 0 or a bit 1 and never the actual values of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. Since one cannot determine the values of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ from a single qubit, it cannot be copied and repetition codes fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Phase-flip error: This has no analogue in classical error correction and therefore not as easy to construct a correction mechanism for.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Arbitrary errors: Bit-flip and phase-flip errors are \"large\" errors leading to a completely opposite state. Errors in qubits, however, can be small and perturb $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ values only slightly by $\\epsilon$. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. No-measurement allowed: Not only that no-cloning theorem prohibits copying of qubits, one cannot make any kind of measurement on the original qubit you want to protect from errors. This will collapse the qubit and original information contained in it can never be recovered. "

Since at most one qubit is assumed to be in error two of these parity checks are enough. Our main goal is to distinguish which qubit is different. For example if we check (1,2) and (2,3) and the first parity check results in a 1 and the second in a 0, then we know that the first qubit is different from the second qubit and the second and third qubits are identical. Recall that CNOT is equivalent to an XOR operation and is used to implement these parity checks. However, these XOR operations cannot be done in place and we need a \"blank slate\" to write the results on. Therefore, the receiver uses two additional ancillary qubits to determine the error syndrome."
